					<p>Dear Students,</p>
					<br />
					<p>Greetings from the Student Welfare Department!</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Firstly, let me introduce myself for the new students - my name is
						Savina Peneva and I will be assisting you regarding your residence
						permit registration - you can find me in office 410d. ðŸ˜Š
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						I would like to ask you to read carefully the information below that
						is related to your residence permits applications:
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						You must keep a close eye on your validity and bear in mind that you
						have to apply for renewal no later than 2 weeks prior to the
						expiration date of the permit in order to avoid a penalty. Please
						contact me at least 1 month before your card expires, so that I can
						prepare the necessary documents in a timely manner.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						I would like to kindly ask you as soon as you have your card to send
						me photos of it - front and back! Thank you in advance! :)
					</p>
